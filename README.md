# Chorume Bot Ecosystem

A comprehensive Discord bot ecosystem built with Docker containers, featuring economy management, daily rewards, user transfers, AI integration, and a robust microservices architecture.

## üéÆ Discord Bot Features

The Chorume Bot provides a complete economy system and AI assistant through Discord slash commands:

### üí∞ Economy Commands
- `/register` - Join the economy system
- `/daily` - Claim daily coins (100 coins/day)
- `/balance [user]` - Check coin balance
- `/transfer <user> <amount>` - Send coins to other users
- `/leaderboard` - View top users by balance
- `/history` - View transaction history

### ü§ñ AI Commands
- `/ai <prompt> [provider] [system_prompt] [model]` - Ask the AI (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) any question or request

### üìä Information Commands  
- `/status` - Check all microservices health
- `/help` - Show all available commands
- `/daily_history` - View daily claim history

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Setup the system:**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Discord bot:**
   - Get bot token from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Edit `.env` file with your `DISCORD_TOKEN` and any AI API keys
   - Invite bot to your server with slash command permissions

3. **Start using:**
   ```
   /register    # Join the economy
   /daily       # Get your first coins
   /balance     # Check your wealth
   /ai          # Use the AI assistant
   ```

## Architecture

The system uses a microservices architecture with Docker containers communicating through a shared network. Each container is independently deployable and scalable, making it easy to add new features or support additional programming languages.
